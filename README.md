# StrippingTillDeath-2
StrippingTillDeath 2 is written out of scratch for OpenComputers but uses a similiar logic like in StrippingTillDeath

The Simplistic version is the first version without any good features. It just strip mines and the variables can be changed in the code.

go look under MappedArea to customize the variables
